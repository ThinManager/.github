# Welcome to ThinManager® organization!

Welcome to [ThinManager®](http://www.thinmanager.com/), a content delivery and thin client management software solution that manages access to HMIs and other industrial-focused productivity content. ThinManager can securely deliver applications to devices like thin clients, industrial PCs, and mobile tablets. ThinManager also delivers content to users based on their their role, location, or based on events that trigger notifications, etc.

ThinManager balances the responsibilities between IT and OT for industrial facilities. ThinManager automatically syncs with Active Directory giving IT full control over network authentication and access. ThinManager, in turn, allows OT to manage authorization to devices and content used in industrial production environments. 

ThinManager supports hundreds of thin client devices from a variety of hardware vendors including Allen-Bradley. ThinManager also supports the use of IP cameras, smart card readers, biometric devices and mobile tablets. ThinManager provides a configuration wizard that allows administrators to simply "click and configure" any asset managed by ThinManager. Alternatively, you can use the Rest API to manage your ThinManager deployments with a more modern toolset.

Whether you manage a single facility or a global enterprise, ThinManager easily scales to accomodate virtually any type of industrial environment. Combined with the right industrial hardware, ThinManager improves security and productivity, and can help provide a more sustainable hardware life cycle for your modern facility.

## General information

These repositories have been created by our most talented technicians to show the endless capabilities of [ThinManager®](http://www.thinmanager.com/), feel free to clone these repositories, use your favorite IDE (like Microsoft [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and test them.

The examples provided are to be used as a reference for building your own application and should not be used in production as-is. It is recommended to adapt the example for the purpose, observing the highest safety standards.

### Definitions:

`Demo` is an application that shows the high-level functionality of ThinManager. Demo applications may contain a significant amount of internal code used to simulate the application. The internal code does not always represent the best practices of ThinManager application design. It is best to not reverse engineer/re-use demo applications, as they are not suitable for direct use in a production environment.

`Sample` is an application that shows a specific feature and can be reverse-engineered easily to understand how they work. To be used as a guide only for production application development. Not suitable for direct use in a production environment.  

Read through the entire ReadMe file to determine what additional ThinManager applications or settings may be needed to ensure the proper emulation of the demo or sample.
